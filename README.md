 Employee Profiling System Requirements
1. User Management

Registration:
Employees can self-register on the platform using their work email address.
During registration, they should be able to create a password and set a profile picture.
Login:
Employees can log in using their work email address and password.
Implement a secure login process with password hashing and salting.
Profile Management:
Employees can view and edit their profiles at any time.
The profile should include editable fields for:
Name
Surname
Email address (work email only, pre-populated during registration)
Phone number (optional)
Department (dropdown menu with available departments)
Personal Summary (text area with character limit)
2. Profile Visibility and Access

View All Profiles:
There should be a dedicated page to list all employee profiles.
This page should display a stylish and user-friendly overview of each profile, including:
Profile picture
Name
Department
Clicking on an employee's profile picture or name should lead to a detailed profile view.
Detailed Profile View:
A separate page should display the full profile details of each employee, including all information from the profile management section.
This page should maintain a stylish design that complements the profile listing page.
Privacy Controls (Optional):
Consider implementing features that allow employees to control specific profile information visibility (e.g., phone number).
3. System Design

Stylish Design:
The entire platform should have a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
Utilize modern design principles and a consistent style throughout the application.
Responsiveness:
The system should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.
4. Security Considerations

Implement secure data storage practices for employee information.
Enforce strong password policies.
Regularly update the system to address any potential security vulnerabilities.
5. Additional Considerations

Search Functionality:
Allow users to search for employee profiles by name, department, or keywords within the personal summary.
Accessibility:
Ensure the system complies with accessibility standards to cater to users with disabilities.
This is a high-level overview of the requirements for an employee profiling system. Specific details and functionalities can be further refined based on your organization's needs and preferences.
